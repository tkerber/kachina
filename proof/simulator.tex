\subsection{The Simulator}
\label{sec:simulator}

The simulator for $\kachina$ has fairly little work to do. It creates simulated
transactions by creating a simulated NIZK proof, and attaching it to the leakage
$x$. Secondly, when presented with an unknown transaction, and, asked for the
corresponding input, it attempts to extract the input from the simulated
zero-knowledge functionality.
