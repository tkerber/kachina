Smart contracts are typically implemented as replicated state machines. If a
\emph{replicated} state machine is the implementation, the natural model is that
of the state machine itself. Inputs are drawn from a ledger of transactions, and
passed to this state machine.

This definition is unsuitable for privacy-preserving smart contracts: If the
state machine's behavior is known, and its inputs are on a ledger, there is no
privacy. A simple tweak can solve this: Inputs are replaced with identifiers on
the ledger, with the smart contract functionality tracking what their
corresponding inputs are.
