\subsection{UC Specification}
\label{sec:fsc}

The \emph{ideal smart contract functionality} $\fsc$ captures the
notion of a contract as a leaky state machine whose inputs are drawn
from a ledger. It is parameterized by the transition function $\tnsfn$
and the leakage function $\lkgfn$, and it operates in a hybrid world with a
global ledger functionality $\gledger$. A candidate for such a ledger is
$\gsimpleledger$, as \iffull introduced in
\autoref{app:ledgers}\else provided in \cite[Appendix~B]{fullversion}\fi, although any
compatible functionality is sufficient. Its privacy guarantees stem from
only revealing explicitly leaked data, i.e. $\vn{lkg}$, and only allowing the
creator of a transaction to access the result.
