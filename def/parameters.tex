Some combinations of $\tnsfn$ and $\lkgfn$ are not obviously realizable, in
particular the more restricted the leakage becomes. They are able to capture
existing smart contract systems however, both
privacy-preserving and otherwise. For instance, a leakage function which leaks
the input itself corresponds closely to
Ethereum~\cite{ethereum}, while a leakage function returning no leakage makes
many transition functions hard or impossible to realize. This paper focuses on a
more interesting middle ground. By defining the ideal
behavior to interact with $\gledger$, we avoid having to duplicate the complex
adversarial influence of ledger protocols. We make few assumptions about this ledger,
requiring only the common prefix property, and interfaces for submitting and
reading transactions to be well defined.
