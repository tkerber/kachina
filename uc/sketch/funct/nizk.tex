\begin{functionalitysketch}{$\fnizk$}
  The (non-malleable) non-interactive zero-knowledge functionality
  $\fnizk$ allows proving of statements in an NP language $\lang$.

  \begin{receivesketch}{prove}{x, w}
    If $(x, w) \in \lang$, query the adversary for a unique NIZK proof
    $\nizkproof$, and record the pair $(x, \nizkproof)$ as valid. Return
    $\nizkproof$.
  \end{receivesketch}
  \begin{receivesketch}{verify}{x, \nizkproof}
    If $(x, \nizkproof)$ has not been recorded as valid or invalid, query the
    adversary for a witness. If a valid witness is supplied, record the pair as
    valid, otherwise as invalid. Return if the pair has been recorded as valid.
  \end{receivesketch}
