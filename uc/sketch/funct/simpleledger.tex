\begin{functionalitysketch}{$\gsimpleledger$}
    The simplified interface to $\gledger$ is strictly less powerful than
    actual ledger implementations, allowing reasoning about a less complex
    ledger functionality.

    \vspace{1em}
    \noindent\emph{Adversarial influence:}

    We allow the adversary to append arbitrarily to a canonical ledger state
    (initialized to $\epsilon$). We further allow it to set each party's view of
    the ledger, provided it is a prefix of the canonical ledger state, and an
    extension of the previous view this party had.

    \vspace{1em}
    \noindent\emph{Honest interaction:}

    We allow parties to \textsc{submit} transactions. This does nothing
    notifying the adversary of $\tx$. While the adversary has no obligation to
    every put transactions on the ledger, in interesting protocol executions it
    usually does. Further, we allow parties to $\textsc{read}$ their own view
    of the ledger state.
