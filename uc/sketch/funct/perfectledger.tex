\begin{functionalitysketch}{$\gperfectledger$}
    The perfect ledger is strictly \emph{more} powerful than actual ledger
    implementations.%

    \vspace{1em}
    \noindent\emph{Honest interaction:}

    We allow parties to \textsc{submit} transactions, which append them to a
    canonical ledger state (initialized to $\epsilon$). Further, parties may at
    any time \textsc{read} the canonical ledger state in its entirety.
