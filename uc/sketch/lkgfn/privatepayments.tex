\begin{leakagefnsketch}{$\lkgfn_{\mathsf{pp}}$}
  Each operation on $\tnsfn_{\mathsf{pp}}$ has minimal leakage, revealing only
  which operation was performed, and in the case of a transfer, the ledger length and
  the recipient -- if and only if the recipient is corrupted.

  \begin{receiveinputsketch*}{$(\partyview = (\ell, U, T, \jointstate), \party, w)$}
    Reject initialization transactions if $\jointstate$ is already initialized, or
    a transaction in $U$ is an initializing transaction. Reject spending
    transactions if the coins held in $\jointstate$, minus the coins spend in each
    transaction in $U$ is not greater than zero.

    Leak the type of transaction (\textsc{init}, \textsc{send}, \textsc{mint},
    or \textsc{balance}). If the transaction is $\textsc{send}$, leak the ledger length
    $\ell$, and, if the receiving public key is adversarial, the recipient. There
    are no dependencies. In the case of minting, provide the calling party's
    public key as a context, in the case of balance queries, combine the
    available balance and provide this as a context.
