\begin{transitionfn}{$\tnsfnkachina_{\vn{chaindata}}$}
  The chain data transition function $\tnsfnkachina_{\vn{chaindata}}$ allow
  arbitrary setting and reading of state. An external assumption is that the
  setting of state is both enforced and restricted by the underlying ledger
  protocol, to give it meaning -- for instance each block may induce a phantom
  ``chain-data'' transaction which appears on the ledger, and sets the most
  recent block hash in the chain-data contracts state.
