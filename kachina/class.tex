\subsection{The Contract Class}
\label{sec:classkachina}

The core \kachina\ protocol can realize a class of smart contracts, with each
contract being primarily defined by a restricted transition function
$\tnsfnkachina$. This transition function is given oracle access to the calling
user's private state $\rho_\party$ and the shared public state $\sigma$, as
described in \autoref{def:oracle}. In addition to these oracle accesses,
  $\tnsfnkachina$ can make $\msg{commit}{y}$ queries, which a) send
  $\msg{commit}{}$ to both oracles, and b) record the value $y$ in a vector of
  partial results $\partresults$.\ We write $\partresults \gets
  \tnsfnkachina_{\oracle_\sigma, \oracle_\rho}(w)$ as running the transition
  function against input $w$, with oracles $\oracle_\sigma$ and $\oracle_\rho$,
  returning the vector of partial results $\partresults$. The final output of
  $\tnsfnkachina$ is appended to $\partresults$ when it returns.\ The adversary
can program its own private state oracle -- it corresponds to local computation,
after all! Two minor functions are also used to define the corresponding ideal
contract:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The leakage descriptor $\vn{desc}$, which receives the time $t$, the
    sequence of secret-expanded unconfirmed transactions $X$, transcripts
    $\transcript_\sigma, \transcript_\rho$, original input $w$, and context $z$
    of new transactions as inputs, and returns a description of what leakage this
    interaction will incur.
  \item A dependency function $\vn{dep}$ satisfying \autoref{def:dep}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}
  $\classkachina$ is the set of all pairs $(\tnsfnmainkachina(\tnsfnkachina),\allowbreak
  \lkgfnmainkachina(\tnsfnkachina, \vn{desc},\allowbreak \vn{dep}))$, for any
  parameters $\tnsfnkachina$, $\vn{desc}$ and $\vn{dep}$, satisfying
  \autoref{def:dep}.
\end{definition}

\noindent $\tnsfnmainkachina$ and $\lkgfnmainkachina$ operate as
follows, with a full description in
\iffull\autoref{sec:fullfuncts}\else\cite[Appendix~C]{fullversion}\fi. We assume the set of honest parties $\honest$ -- in
the ideal world, this is known by the functionality, while in the real world we
assume each party $\party$ will use $\honest = \{\party\}$.
