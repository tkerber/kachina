\paragraph{Inherent conflicts}
Abstracting the interaction with the state has many benefits, but it is not a
panacea. Some conflicts are inherent, and unavoidable -- a contract may operate
on a first-come first-serve basis, and no trick will ease the pain of coming
second. A contract may also simply be badly designed, not making good use of
the abstractions provided -- at the most extreme, it can make only queries
retrieving or setting the entire state, negating all benefit of using oracles.
