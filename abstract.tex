\begin{abstract}
  Smart contracts present a uniform approach for deploying distrib\-uted
  computation and have become a popular means to develop security critical 
  applications. A major barrier to adoption for many applications is the
  public nature of existing systems, such as Ethereum. Several
  systems satisfying various definitions of privacy and requiring various trust
  assumptions have been proposed; however, none achieved the universality
  and uniformity
  that Ethereum achieved for non-private contracts: One unified method to
  construct most contracts.

  \sloppy
  We provide a unified security model for private smart
  contracts which is based on the Universal Composition (UC) model and propose a
  novel core protocol, \kachina, for deploying privacy-preserving smart contracts,
  which encompasses previous systems. We demonstrate the
  \kachina\ method of smart contract development, using it to construct a contract that implements
  privacy-preserving payments, along the lines of Zerocash, which is provably
  secure in the UC setting and facilitates concurrency.%
