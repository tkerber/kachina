\subsection{Ideal Private Payments}

To simplify the external interface, we only use single denomination coins. The
same approach can be applied to the full Zerocash protocol, with some caveats on
coin selection and leakage.

We formally specify the private token 
contract through its transition and leakage functions, $\tnsfn_{\mathsf{pp}}$
and $\lkgfn_{\mathsf{pp}}$. The contract supports the following inputs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\msg{init}{}$, giving a party a unique public key
  \item $\msg{send}{\pk}$, sending a coin to the public key $\pk$
  \item $\msg{mint}{}$, creating a new coin for the calling party
  \item $\msg{balance}{}$, returning the current balance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Zerocash \kachina\ Contract}
\label{app:zerocashkachina}

The contract implementing Zerocash, which we will use to realize the private
token contract, follows its source protocol closely, albeit with single
denomination coins.

\sloppy We can observe that (with some help from the simulator), the ideal Zerocash
  contract, given by $(\tnsfn_\vn{zc}, \lkgfn_\vn{zc}) =\allowbreak
  (\tnsfnmainkachina(\tnsfnkachina_\vn{zc}),\allowbreak \lkgfnmainkachina(\tnsfnkachina,
  \vn{desc}_\vn{zc}, \vn{dep}_\vn{zc}))$, is equivalent to the ideal private
  payments contract $(\tnsfn_\vn{pp}, \lkgfn_\vn{pp})$. Formally, we instantiate
  two instances of $\fsc$, as presented in \autoref{sec:fsc}, and show that any
  attack against $(\tnsfn_\vn{zc}, \lkgfn_\vn{zc})$ can be simulated against
  $(\tnsfn_\vn{pp}, \lkgfn_\vn{pp})$.

\subimport*{./}{theorem}

This proof can also be carried out via invariants. Here the invariant tracking
is simple: The real and ideal world have the same coins owned by the same users
at any time. Our simulator, described in \iffull\autoref{sec:fullpp}\else\cite[Appendix~C.4]{fullversion}\fi, has a lot of
book-keeping to do, mostly to conjure up fake commitments and encryptions for
the real-world adversary, and replicating them in the real world. We provide a
full proof sketch in \iffull\autoref{app:ppproof}\else\cite[Appendix~E]{fullversion}\fi.
